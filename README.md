# üß† YOLOX Custom Training - Abandoned Object Detection

This project demonstrates how to train a **YOLOX (You Only Look Once X)** object detection model on a custom dataset, specifically tailored for object detection in surveillance footage or real-world environments.

*(NOTE :- before starting to implement things using the docs, I would recommed to first go through it in depth and check the titles and important things that have been marked in the docx file)*

## üìå Project Summary

This repository provides a detailed pipeline for:

- Preparing custom datasets.
- Setting up a GPU-accelerated environment for training with YOLOX.
- Configuring experiment files for model customization.
- Training and evaluating the model.
- Running inference on images and videos.
- Exporting models for deployment (ONNX/TensorRT).

## üë§ Who is this for?

This project is ideal for:

- **Computer Vision researchers and engineers** building real-time object detection systems.
- **Security and surveillance teams** interested in detecting abandoned or unusual items in public spaces.
- **AI/ML students or enthusiasts** learning how to train models using YOLOX on custom datasets.
- **Developers** deploying object detection solutions on edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson, etc.).
